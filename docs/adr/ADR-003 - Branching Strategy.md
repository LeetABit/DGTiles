# ADR-003: Branching Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project requires a clear and maintainable Git history to facilitate
collaboration, simplify debugging, and ensure code quality. A linear history
branching strategy enforces a strict workflow where changes are rebased and
squashed before being merged into the main branch. This approach results in a
clean commit history without unnecessary merge commits or redundant information.

## Decision

We decided to adopt a linear history branching strategy for this project.

## Reasons

1. **Clean and Readable Git History**:

   - A linear history avoids clutter caused by merge commits, making it easier
     to understand the sequence of changes.

2. **Simplified Debugging**:

   - A clear, chronological history helps identify issues and trace changes to
     specific commits more efficiently.

3. **Encourages Atomic Commits**:

   - Squashing changes into meaningful commits ensures that each commit is
     self-contained and describes a single logical change.

4. **Enhanced Code Review Process**:

   - Rebasing and squashing changes before merging encourages developers to
     review their commits, ensuring quality and clarity.

5. **Improved Collaboration**:

   - A clean history reduces confusion for contributors, making it easier to
     onboard new team members and collaborate effectively.

6. **Compatibility with CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Linear history simplifies the integration process for CI/CD pipelines,
     reducing potential conflicts during automated builds and deployments.

## Consequences

1. **Increased Developer Responsibility**:

   - Developers must rebase their changes and resolve conflicts before merging,
     which requires familiarity with Git commands and workflows.

2. **Potential for Accidental Rewrite**:

   - Incorrect use of rebasing or force-pushing can lead to history rewriting,
     which may disrupt collaboration if not done carefully.

3. **Workflow Enforcement**:
   - Requires discipline and adherence to the branching strategy, including pull
     request reviews and rebase workflows.

## Alternatives Considered

### Merge Commits with Feature Branches:

- **Pros**: Easier for beginners, retains a record of merge operations.
- **Cons**: Creates a cluttered history with redundant commits, making it
  harder to trace changes.

### GitFlow:

- **Pros**: Provides a well-defined branching model with support for multiple
  environments (e.g., development, release, hotfix).
- **Cons**: Overly complex for smaller or fast-paced projects, with
  unnecessary branches that may slow down workflows.

### GitHub Flow:

- **Pros**: Simple and effective for continuous deployment workflows; focuses
  on feature branches and pull requests.
- **Cons**: Does not explicitly enforce a linear history and may result in
  merge commits if not carefully managed.

### Hybrid Approaches (e.g., Squash Merges):

- **Pros**: Combines a clean main branch with detailed feature branch
  histories.
- **Cons**: Adds complexity by requiring developers to maintain feature
  branches separately.

### No Specific Strategy:

- **Pros**: Minimal setup or process.
- **Cons**: Leads to an inconsistent history that is difficult to maintain
  and understand.
