# ADR-001: Architecture Decision Records

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project requires a structured way to document significant architectural and
technical decisions to ensure clarity, consistency, and traceability over time.
Since the project currently has only one developer, there is a risk of decisions
being undocumented or becoming difficult to explain later. Adopting a
lightweight, standardized format can mitigate these risks and support future
scalability as the project grows.

## Decision

We decided to use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant
decisions in the project.

## Reasons

1. **Clarity and Transparency**:
   ADRs provide a clear and concise format to record the context, decision, and
   consequences of architectural choices, making it easier to understand the
   rationale behind them.

2. **Long-term Memory**:
   Documenting decisions ensures that the reasoning behind them is preserved,
   avoiding re-evaluation of the same problems and helping new contributors
   understand the project's history.

3. **Scalability for Team Growth**:
   As the project grows and more developers join, ADRs will serve as a shared
   reference point for decision-making and onboarding.

4. **Lightweight and Flexible**:
   The ADR format is simple to implement and maintain, requiring minimal
   overhead while still providing significant value.

5. **Standard Practice**:
   Using ADRs aligns with industry best practices for managing architectural
   decisions in software projects.

## Consequences

1. The use of ADRs requires consistency in writing and maintaining them, which
   will need to be integrated into the development workflow.

2. Decisions will need to be periodically reviewed to ensure they remain
   relevant and reflect the current state of the project.

## Alternatives Considered

### No Formal Documentation:

- **Pros**: No additional effort or overhead.
- **Cons**: Risks of undocumented decisions leading to confusion,
  inefficiency, and potential rework in the future.

### Informal Notes:

- **Pros**: Easy to create and manage without a structured format.
- **Cons**: Lack of consistency and standardization, making it harder to
  retrieve and understand decisions.
