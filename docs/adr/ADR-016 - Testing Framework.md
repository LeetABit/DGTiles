# ADR-016: Testing Framework

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project requires a testing framework that is fast, efficient, and compatible
with modern JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems. The framework must integrate
seamlessly with the chosen build tool (Vite) and support unit testing,
integration testing, and potentially snapshot testing.

## Decision

We decided to use Vitest as the testing framework for the project.

## Reasons

1. **Seamless Integration with Vite**:

   - Vitest is designed to work natively with Vite, providing an out-of-the-box
     setup and efficient testing workflows.

2. **Speed and Efficiency**:

   - Vitest leverages Vite's fast build and HMR capabilities to provide rapid
     test execution, improving developer productivity.

3. **TypeScript Support**:

   - Vitest offers excellent TypeScript support, ensuring type safety and
     compatibility with the project’s codebase.

4. **Modern Features**:

   - Vitest supports advanced features like mocking, snapshot testing, and
     built-in assertions, reducing the need for additional libraries.

5. **Consistency with the Ecosystem**:

   - Using Vitest aligns the testing framework with the project's build tool
     (Vite), simplifying configuration and reducing potential compatibility
     issues.

6. **Improved Developer Experience**:

   - Vitest provides a modern and intuitive API, including features like watch
     mode and detailed test results, enhancing the testing experience.

7. **Growing Community and Ecosystem**:

   - Vitest has an active and growing community, ensuring access to support,
     plugins, and continuous improvements.

## Consequences

1. **Learning Curve**:

   - Developers familiar with other testing frameworks like Jest may need to
     adapt to Vitest’s API and features, though the transition is relatively
     straightforward.

2. **Evolving Ecosystem**:

   - As a relatively newer tool, Vitest’s ecosystem is still maturing, which may
     require monitoring for updates and potential breaking changes.

3. **Limited Legacy Tooling Support**:

   - Some older tools or plugins designed for other frameworks like Jest may not
     yet be available or compatible with Vitest.

## Alternatives Considered

### Jest:

- **Pros**: Widely adopted, rich ecosystem, supports TypeScript and advanced
  testing features.
- **Cons**: Slower performance and less seamless integration with Vite.

### Mocha + Chai:

- **Pros**: Flexible and lightweight.
- **Cons**: Requires more manual configuration and lacks modern features like
  mocking and snapshot testing.

### Jasmine:

- **Pros**: Mature framework with a simple setup.
- **Cons**: Less active development and lacks some modern testing
  capabilities.
