# ADR-022: Frontend Framework

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project requires a modern, component-based frontend framework to build a
dynamic and maintainable user interface. Key requirements include strong
community support, reusable UI components, integration with TypeScript, support
for modern tooling, and the ability to scale with growing complexity.

Several frontend frameworks were considered, including React, Vue, Svelte, and
Angular.

## Decision

We decided to use **React** as the frontend framework for the project.

## Reasons

1. **Component-Based Architecture**:
   - React promotes the creation of reusable and composable components,
     improving code maintainability and scalability.

2. **Strong Ecosystem and Community**:
   - React has a mature ecosystem, widespread adoption, and excellent community
     support, ensuring access to libraries, tooling, and best practices.

3. **TypeScript Compatibility**:
   - React has robust TypeScript support, enhancing code safety and developer
     productivity in large-scale applications.

4. **Declarative UI**:
   - React's declarative programming model simplifies reasoning about UI state
     and behavior, leading to fewer bugs and clearer code.

5. **Tooling and Integrations**:
   - First-class integration with modern build tools (e.g. Vite, Webpack),
     testing libraries (e.g. Testing Library, Vitest), and styling solutions
     (e.g. Tailwind, styled-components).

6. **Platform Flexibility**:
   - React can be used across platforms (web, mobile via React Native, desktop
     via Electron), offering potential code sharing and architectural
     consistency.

7. **Long-Term Stability**:
   - Backed by Meta (Facebook) and widely used in industry, React provides
     confidence in long-term maintenance and ecosystem evolution.

## Consequences

1. **Learning Curve for Advanced Concepts**:
   - Concepts like hooks, context, and rendering behavior may be non-trivial for
     developers new to React or functional programming.

2. **Unopinionated by Design**:
   - React focuses on the view layer, so additional decisions are required for
     routing, state management, and data fetching (e.g., using React Router,
     Zustand, TanStack Query, etc.).

3. **Frequent Ecosystem Updates**:
   - Rapid evolution of libraries and patterns in the React ecosystem requires
     the team to stay up to date to avoid technical debt.

## Alternatives Considered

### Vue:

- **Pros**: Simpler learning curve, batteries-included experience with Vue
  CLI and Vuex.
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, less widespread enterprise adoption compared
  to React.

### Angular:

- **Pros**: Fully integrated framework with strong TypeScript support and
  built-in tooling.
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, more opinionated structure, heavier
  initial setup.

### Svelte:

- **Pros**: Compiles to efficient vanilla JavaScript, minimal runtime, simple
  syntax.
- **Cons**: Smaller community, ecosystem still maturing, limited enterprise
  adoption.
