# ADR-006: Feature Specification

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the project grows, features may introduce changes that span across multiple
parts of the codebase and configuration files. These changes can be difficult to
track and understand, especially when features are removed or modified in the
future. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to document each feature in a
dedicated file, providing a single source of truth for its purpose,
implementation, and any project-wide impacts.

## Decision

We decided that each feature in the project will have its own dedicated
documentation topic file.

### Proposed Structure for Feature Documentation Files

Each feature documentation file should include the following sections:

1. **Overview**:
   A brief description of the feature, including its purpose and how it benefits
   the project.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   Key aspects of the feature's implementation, including any important
   technical details or architectural considerations.

3. **Project-Wide Changes**:
   A list of all changes made to configuration files, dependencies, or other
   areas of the project as part of implementing the feature.

4. **Dependencies**:
   Details about external libraries, APIs, or services that the feature relies
   on, along with their versions or configurations.

5. **Usage**:
   Instructions for using or testing the feature, if applicable.

6. **Removal Considerations**:
   Specific steps or notes to follow if the feature is ever removed, including
   files or configurations that need to be reverted or cleaned up.

## Reasons

1. **Centralized Documentation**:
   Each feature will have a single file documenting all relevant details, making
   it easier to understand and manage.

2. **Future-proofing**:
   If a feature is removed, its documentation will provide clear guidance on
   reversing changes and avoiding unintended side effects.

3. **Improved Maintainability**:
   Developers can quickly locate and review the scope of a feature's impact
   without searching through multiple files or commit histories.

4. **Traceability**:
   The documentation ensures that feature-specific decisions and changes are
   preserved, aiding in troubleshooting and onboarding new contributors.

5. **Standardized Approach**:
   A consistent structure for feature documentation improves readability and
   reduces the cognitive load for developers.

## Consequences

1. Writing feature-specific documentation will require additional effort during
   feature implementation, but this is offset by the long-term maintainability
   benefits.

2. Contributors will need to adhere to the proposed documentation structure to
   maintain consistency.

## Alternatives Considered

### General Documentation Without Separation:
   - **Pros**: Simpler structure, no additional files.
   - **Cons**: Difficult to locate feature-specific information; risk of
     cluttered or incomplete documentation.

### Inline Comments in Code:
   - **Pros**: Documentation stays close to the implementation.
   - **Cons**: Limited scope; hard to include broader project-wide changes or
     removal considerations.
