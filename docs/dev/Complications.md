# Complications

## Props css and style

Emotion does not allow the use of the `css` prop on custom React components;
however, the `css` prop is required for native HTML elements. This limitation
may be addressed in future releases. If a future attempt is made to test this
behavior, a detailed instruction should be added here to enable quick
verification of whether the issue persists.
